Animal Species Classification with Deep Learning:
Utilizing over a thousand photos representing diverse animal species, I employed machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop a self-teaching model. Achieving a 90% success rate, the model accurately recognizes and assigns correct labels to images of various animal species based on their visual features.

NFL Play-by-Play Red Zone Analysis:
Based on a dataset containing all regular season plays from the 2009-2016 NFL seasons, I conducted elaborate data wrangling and analysis on over 35 million data points. The resulting data visualizations and models helped identify and predict which types of plays were most successful in the red zone, which types of plays had the best success rate on specific opposing teams in the red zone, and historically which teams had the highest defensive success rate of stopping a touchdown in the red zone.

Wind Power Prediction with Random Forests:
I developed a random forest model to predict the wind power output predictability of four distinct locations, comparing the predictions to their actual historical power output based on recorded features such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, dew point, and more. Expanding this approach to numerous locations could prove invaluable for determining optimal sites for future wind turbines, maximizing clean energy power output while at the same time enhancing operational efficiency and optimizing resource utilization.
